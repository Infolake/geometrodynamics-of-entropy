ðŸš€ **BREAKTHROUGH IN FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS** ðŸš€

Dr. Guilherme de Camargo announces the release of groundbreaking research integrating three-dimensional time theory with black hole cosmology, potentially revolutionizing our understanding of the universe's origin. The new "CTMCK Theory" (Camargo-Kletetschka Multidimensional Temporal Cosmogenesis) proposes that our observable universe originated from inside a primordial black hole, with cosmic evolution governed by three temporal dimensions rather than one. This framework naturally explains quantum entanglement through temporal correlations, resolves the puzzle of ultra-massive galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, and makes specific testable predictions including neutrino masses of 0.29 eV and gravitational wave signatures detectable by the LISA mission. The research, now available on arXiv and with complete source code on GitHub, represents the first successful unification of quantum mechanics, general relativity, and cosmology through temporal multidimensionality, opening new avenues for understanding consciousness, stellar habitability, and the fundamental nature of reality itself.
