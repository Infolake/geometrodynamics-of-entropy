We present a novel cosmological framework integrating Kletetschka's three-dimensional time theory with black hole bounce cosmology. Our model proposes that our observable universe originated from the interior of a primordial black hole, with cosmic evolution governed by three temporal dimensions: quantum-local (t₁), relational-systemic (t₂), and cosmological (t₃). The theory naturally explains quantum entanglement through temporal correlations, resolves the JWST early massive galaxy problem via inherited structural seeds, and predicts specific observational signatures including neutrino masses (0.29 eV), torsional gravitational waves detectable by LISA (~10⁻² Hz), and Kaluza-Klein resonances at 2.3-4.1 TeV. We develop a comprehensive stellar temporal habitability framework, demonstrating that M-type stars optimize long-term complexity development through temporal dimension balance. The model provides testable predictions for particle accelerators, gravitational wave detectors, and astronomical observations, offering a unified approach to fundamental physics that bridges quantum mechanics, general relativity, and cosmology while maintaining compatibility with established observational constraints.
