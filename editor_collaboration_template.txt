Subject: CTMCK Theory - Novel Three-Dimensional Time Cosmology for Review/Collaboration

Dear [Editor Name / Dr. Surname],

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Dr. Guilherme de Camargo, and I am writing to introduce a novel theoretical framework that may be of interest to [Journal Name / your research group].

## CTMCK Theory Overview
I have developed the **CTMCK (Camargo-Kletetschka Multidimensional Temporal Cosmogenesis) Theory**, which extends G√ºnther Kletetschka's three-dimensional time framework to black hole bounce cosmology. This unified approach addresses several fundamental questions in modern physics:

### Key Innovations:
‚Ä¢ **Quantum-Relativistic Unification**: First framework to unify quantum mechanics, general relativity, and cosmology via temporal dimensions
‚Ä¢ **JWST Anomaly Resolution**: Explains early massive galaxy observations through bounce universe inheritance
‚Ä¢ **Testable Predictions**: Specific predictions for neutrino masses (0.29 eV), LISA gravitational waves, and Kaluza-Klein resonances
‚Ä¢ **Stellar Habitability Framework**: Novel approach to life complexity optimization through temporal analysis

### Current Status:
üìÑ **Preprint**: Available on arXiv ([arXiv:PENDING](https://arxiv.org/abs/PENDING))  
üìä **DOI**: [10.5281/zenodo.PENDING](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.PENDING)  
üîó **Repository**: [github.com/infolake/guilherme-ctmck](https://github.com/infolake/guilherme-ctmck)

### Background:
As an emergency physician with a passion for fundamental physics, I bring a unique interdisciplinary perspective to theoretical cosmology. My medical training in complex systems analysis has informed the development of this temporal framework.

## Next Steps:
I would be honored to:
- Submit the full manuscript for peer review in [Journal Name]
- Discuss potential collaboration opportunities
- Present the theory at upcoming conferences or seminars
- Provide additional technical details or clarifications

The theory has been developed with rigorous mathematical foundations and offers multiple avenues for experimental verification. I believe it represents a significant step forward in our understanding of spacetime structure and cosmological evolution.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response and the possibility of contributing to the advancement of theoretical physics through your esteemed [journal/institution].

Best regards,

**Dr. Guilherme de Camargo**
