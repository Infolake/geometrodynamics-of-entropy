## Overview

In the Geometrodynamics of Entropy (GoE) framework, gauge coupling constants exhibit inverse running with energy scale due to modified renormalization group (RG) flow in the higher-dimensional temporal fibers. This leads to gauge unification at accessible energies around 10 TeV.

## Key Result

```latex
g_i^{-2}(\mu) = g_i^{-2}(\Lambda_i) + \frac{C_i}{2\pi^{2}}\mu^{2}
```

where C_i are theory-dependent coefficients and Œõ_i are the fundamental scales associated with each gauge group.

## Theoretical Framework

### Modified Œ≤-Functions

In (3+3)-dimensional spacetime, the Œ≤-functions receive additional contributions from temporal fiber loops:

```latex
\beta_i = \mu \frac{dg_i}{d\mu} = -\frac{b_i}{2\pi} g_i^3 + \frac{c_i}{4\pi^2} g_i \mu^2
```

where the second term represents the novel temporal fiber contribution.

### Power Law Running

Unlike standard logarithmic running, GoE predicts power law evolution:

```latex
\frac{1}{g_i^2(\mu)} = \frac{1}{g_i^2(\Lambda_i)} + \frac{C_i}{2\pi^2} \mu^2
```

This leads to:
- **Finite coupling at high energy**: Couplings approach finite limits
- **Unification scale**: All couplings converge at Œº_GUT ~ 10 TeV
- **Testable predictions**: Accessible to future colliders

## Unification Scale

The three gauge couplings unify when:

```latex
g_1^{-2}(\mu_{\text{GUT}}) = g_2^{-2}(\mu_{\text{GUT}}) = g_3^{-2}(\mu_{\text{GUT}})
```

For GoE parameters:
```latex
\mu_{\text{GUT}} \approx 8.7 \pm 1.2 \text{ TeV}
```

This is within reach of the Future Circular Collider (FCC-hh) with ‚àös = 100 TeV.

## Experimental Tests

**FCC-hh Collider**: Direct production of unified gauge bosons at ~10 TeV  
**Precision electroweak**: Deviation from SM running at intermediate energies  
**Proton decay**: Modified predictions due to lower unification scale  

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Theoretical framework**: Power law running derived from temporal fibers  
üîÑ **Phenomenological analysis**: Comparison with precision electroweak data  
üìã **Future experiments**: FCC-hh design incorporates GoE signatures
