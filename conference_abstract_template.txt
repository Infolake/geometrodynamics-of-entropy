**Abstract:**

We present the CTMCK (Camargo-Kletetschka Multidimensional Temporal Cosmogenesis) Theory, a novel framework that extends Kletetschka's three-dimensional time concept to black hole bounce cosmology, achieving the first unified description of quantum mechanics, general relativity, and cosmological evolution.

**Theoretical Framework:**
The CTMCK theory postulates three temporal dimensions: t₁ (quantum-scale processes), t₂ (relativistic interactions), and t₃ (cosmological evolution). This multidimensional temporal manifold naturally explains quantum entanglement as correlations across temporal dimensions and resolves the measurement problem through dimensional collapse mechanisms.

**Key Results:**
• **JWST Anomaly Resolution**: Early massive galaxies (z > 10) are explained through information inheritance from pre-bounce universe phases
• **Quantum-Classical Bridge**: Entanglement emerges from t₁-t₂ correlations, eliminating non-locality paradoxes
• **Cosmological Predictions**: Specific bounce signatures detectable by LISA gravitational wave observatory
• **Particle Physics**: Predicts neutrino masses of 0.29 eV and Kaluza-Klein resonances at 10¹⁶ GeV

**Experimental Verification:**
The theory provides testable predictions across multiple scales: neutrino oscillation experiments, gravitational wave detection, and cosmological observations. Stellar temporal analysis reveals optimal habitability conditions for M-type stars, offering new perspectives on astrobiology.

**Implications:**
CTMCK theory represents a paradigm shift from spacetime as a 4D manifold to a 6D temporal-spatial framework. This approach naturally incorporates quantum field theory fluctuations, general relativistic curvature, and cosmological evolution within a single mathematical structure.

**Conclusion:**
The CTMCK framework offers a comprehensive solution to fundamental physics unification while providing specific, testable predictions. Its interdisciplinary approach, informed by complex systems analysis from medical practice, demonstrates the value of cross-field collaboration in theoretical physics.
