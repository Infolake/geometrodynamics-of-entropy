🧵 THREAD: Introducing CTMCK Theory - A Revolutionary Approach to Unifying Physics

1/8 🌌 What if time isn't just one dimension, but THREE? As an emergency physician turned theoretical physicist, I've developed the CTMCK Theory that could change how we understand the universe. 

#Physics #QuantumGravity #Cosmology #CTMCK

2/8 🔬 CTMCK (Camargo-Kletetschka Multidimensional Temporal Cosmogenesis) extends 3D time to black hole bounce cosmology, finally unifying:
• Quantum mechanics
• General relativity  
• Cosmological evolution

All in ONE framework! 🤯

3/8 🔭 Remember those massive galaxies JWST found that "shouldn't exist"? CTMCK explains them perfectly through bounce universe inheritance. The early universe wasn't empty - it inherited structure from the previous cosmic cycle.

4/8 ⚛️ Quantum entanglement isn't "spooky action at a distance" - it's correlations across temporal dimensions! This solves the measurement problem and eliminates non-locality paradoxes.

Einstein would be proud. 😊

5/8 🧪 TESTABLE PREDICTIONS:
• Neutrino masses: 0.29 eV
• LISA gravitational waves from bounce signatures
• Kaluza-Klein resonances at 10¹⁶ GeV
• M-type stars = optimal for life complexity

Science you can verify!

6/8 🏥➡️🌌 My medical background in complex systems analysis was crucial for developing this framework. Sometimes the best insights come from unexpected places!

7/8 📊 Full paper available:
📄 arXiv: [PENDING]
📊 DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.[PENDING]
🔗 GitHub: github.com/infolake/guilherme-ctmck

All open access, all reproducible!

8/8 🚀 This is just the beginning. CTMCK opens new frontiers in quantum gravity, cosmology, and astrobiology. The universe is far stranger and more beautiful than we imagined.

Time to make time multidimensional! ⏰³
