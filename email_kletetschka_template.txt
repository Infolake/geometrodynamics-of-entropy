Subject: Extension of Your Three-Dimensional Time Framework to Cosmology - arXiv Preprint

Dear Prof. Kletetschka,

I hope this email finds you well. I am Dr. Guilherme de Camargo, an independent researcher from Brazil, and I have been deeply inspired by your groundbreaking work on three-dimensional time theory published in Reviews of Applied Physics Sciences.

I have recently completed a comprehensive theoretical extension of your framework, applying the three-temporal dimensions to black hole bounce cosmology and fundamental physics unification. The resulting work, "Observable Signatures of a Three-Temporal Bounce-Universe Inside a Black Hole," has just been submitted to arXiv:

üîó **arXiv:** [TO BE FILLED]
üîó **Repository:** https://github.com/infolake/guilherme-ctmck
üè∑Ô∏è **DOI:** [TO BE FILLED FROM ZENODO]

**Key Contributions:**
‚Ä¢ Integration of your (t‚ÇÅ, t‚ÇÇ, t‚ÇÉ) framework with bounce cosmology
‚Ä¢ Explanation of JWST early massive galaxies through temporal inheritance
‚Ä¢ Quantitative predictions for neutrino masses (0.29 eV) and LISA gravitational waves
‚Ä¢ Stellar temporal habitability analysis with M-star optimization
‚Ä¢ Testable signatures for particle accelerators and astronomical observations

The work cites your 2025 paper extensively and builds directly upon your foundational insights about temporal multidimensionality. I would be deeply honored by any feedback you might have, and I am very interested in potential collaboration opportunities.

If you have any questions about the theoretical development or would like to discuss the implications further, I would be delighted to arrange a video call at your convenience.

Thank you for the revolutionary framework that made this research possible.

With great respect and admiration,
